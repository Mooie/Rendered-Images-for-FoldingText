# Rendered Images plugin for FoldingText

This is a plugin for [FoldingText](http://www.foldingtext.com/) app.

Adds @img tag support for lines with a markdown syntax image. Image will display on the following line. For now, images must be hosted and linked directly to the resource (not a page displaying it).

## Example

### TODO:
- add support for percentage widths
- contain image within textarea and not allow larger images to extend to the document bounds (maybe?)
